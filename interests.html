        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Playing Video Games – An obvious one for me. I love playing Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing, or Red Dead Redemption 2. I think I just like being a farmer, but that’s a little too much commitment for me right now, so I just stick with the video games. </li>
            <li>Reading – I’ve always loved to read since I was little. At 8 I would sit at the dinner table with a book and my parents would have to beg me to put it down. It was essentially my phone as a child. Instead of brainrot though, it was brain-nourishment! </li>
            <li>Writing – I’ve always wanted to write ever since I was little too. I’d like to create a text heavy game one day, and have all the lore interconnected. I think that’d be fun, but timely! </li>
            <li>Watching YouTube – I think this counts as a hobby! I love watching other people play and review video games. It helps me think of ideas that I might want to create one day. </li>
            <li>Sleeping – Okay I’m running out of ideas here, and besides that, I think I’m a pretty professional napper. Like, I could sleep for ages and never get tired. I think if humans could attempt hibernation, I’d be on the frontlines. </li>
